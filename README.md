# Joomla-1.5-Help-Files
From the docs.joomla.org site I downloaded the images and changed the src for the images to (/images/help-1.5/) so that the pages would work. I didn't change the href links that point back to docs.joomla.org because they are currently working. Alos there is no css just plain html.
