# Joomla-1.5-Help-Files
From the docs.joomla.org site I downloaded the images and the html files. Then modified the file names so they would match the original Joomla help file names and changed the src of the images to point to (/images/help-1.5/) so that the pages would work. I didn't change the href links that point back to docs.joomla.org because they are currently working.

The files are zipped with the correct directory structure so you should be able to unzip them on your local machine then ssh or ftp into your Joomla site. These files are case sensitive.

In "Global Configuration" set the "Help Server" to "Local" and it will display the new help files.
